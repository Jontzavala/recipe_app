# Recipe-App

Version 1.0.0


With this app you should be able to create a category and create a recipe that belongs to that category. Example: Breakfast would be a category and eggs and bacon will be a recipe given it's a short recipe it is one.

This project was very difficult for me and really stretched me and pushed me to learn alot especially with it being our first javascript application. There is still a lot I need to learn going forward. That's what being a software engineer is though, always learning and growing.
